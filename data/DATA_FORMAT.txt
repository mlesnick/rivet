FORMAT OF DATA FILES

I. Point Cloud (for constructing a Vietoris-Rips complex)

	First line:	the word "points"
	Second line:	dimension of data (integer)
	Third line:	maximum dimension of simplices to construct (integer)
	Fourth line:	maximum length of edges to be constructed (decimal)
	Other lines:	one line per point; each line contains decimal numbers, separated by white space, giving the point's coordinates and birth time
	
	NO EMPTY LINES IN THE FILE!

II. Bifiltration 

	(Here we consider a bifiltration to be abstract, without geometric coordinates.)
	REQUIREMENTS:
		vertices are labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N
		times and distances are nonnegative integers (preferably 0, 1, ..., max_time and 0, 1, ..., max_dist, respectively)
	The program does NOT currently check that the data file represents a logically-consistent bifiltration.
	

	First line:	the word "bifiltration"
	Other lines:	one line per simplex, each line contains number separated by white space:
				first number (integer) gives the dimension of the simplex (here we will call it n)
				next n numbers (integers) give the vertices of the simplex
				next number (decimal) gives the time at which the simplex appears
				final number (decimal) gives the distance at which the simplex appears
