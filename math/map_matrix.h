/**
 * \class	MapMatrix
 * \brief	Stores a matrix representing a simplicial map and provides basic operations.
 * \author	Matthew L. Wright
 * \date	February 2014
 * \warning	In the matrix perspective, row and column indices start at 1, not at 0.
 * 
 * The MapMatrix class stores a matrix representing a simplicial map, such as a boundary map.
 * Such a matrix is a sparse matrix with entries in the two-element field.
 * This implementation is based on that described in the persistent homology survey paper by Edelsbrunner and Harer.
 * Operations are those necessary for persistence computations.
 *
 * Implementation details: A vector contains pointers to the first element (possibly null) in each column; each column is represented by a linked list.
 * Linked lists connecting entries in each row are not implemented.
 * Each entry in the matrix is an instance of the MapMatrixNode class.
